		<description>Google IS Big Brother and this is how it starts. They&#039;ll claim it is only the &quot;bad guys&quot; they&#039;re after and then more and more groups will be &quot;bad&quot; until there is no one left to object. 



First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out--

Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out--

Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out-- 

Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me--and there was no one left to speak for me. 

~ Martin Niemöller (1892-1984) ~</description>

		<description>17th and 18th centuries would think that, But for them to add Yolo in the dictionary is not smart, Just because a bunch of people are say Yolo doesn&#039;t mean it needs to be add in the dictionary. Yolo is lyrics from a popular hip-hop song. So does that mean any new words people are saying or making up we have to add it in the dictionary?</description>

		<description>I just tried out the Twist app and it worked great, I guess you can&#039;t lie to people anymore about how far you are, but being late for me is a never. When you arrive to your destination it alert the person that you have arrive, I think that really great to use.</description>

		<description>Your answer to question #5 is incorrect. Brett Helquist was the illustrator of &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events,&quot; NOT the author. See http://www.bretthelquist.com for his portfolio of work. 

Lemony Snicket is the pen name of Daniel Handler, who has also written several books for adults. http://www.lemony-snicket-stuff.com/daniel_handler_biography.html</description>

		<description>I have two kids. Although it seems more commonplace to see kids at parties toy around with Mom/Dad&#039;s iPhone or iPad, I&#039;d hate to think that would be the future. Even when I was growing up with Gameboys and NES, my parents wanted me to socialize. I can say with certainty that my parents helped me indirectly in how I conduct conversations with important business people that I wouldn&#039;t otherwise approach.</description>
